# Georgia-Prison-Deaths
Recorded deaths among the incarcerated in Georgia Department of Corrections prisons beginning in 2015.

2015 was the first year in which GDC began to assign a cause of death when people die incarcerated in a Georgia prison. Every death also has a death certificate produced by the coroner of the county where the prison is located. This repository has three spreadsheets. One is mortality data as reported by GDC, the second is mortality data from death certificates as recorded by the Georgia Departhment of Public Health and the third records the names in which there is a mismatch between the cause of death recorded by GDC and DPH.
